<p>This site was made to present my skills and progress in working in web design. I have another site on tumblr (where must of my artwork shown will be hosted on so to not go over github's file size limits on repos. Tumblr, after using it for about a year, is more of a hassle to use in terms of making custom layouts and designing than just having pages done from complete scratch. Their use of blocks for certain blog variables (permalinks, photo posts, etc) are great in terms of shortening code and helping the editor follow specific rules to make posts show up, but they're a hassle when it comes to being able to make things look the way you want them to, and manipulating certain DOM things via JS/JQ. For example, trying to edit photosets and retrieve things from them via JS/JQ is a pain in the butt. I know you can pay for access to their API, but I'm a bit short on cash, and that money would be better used to find a domain host.</p>
